# 2. Use React as architecture

Date: 17/08/2019

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Top level archtitecture of app was needed to begin work.

Ultimately a GraphQL endpoint would support the server side portion of this app.

React is a clean client side toolset for creating SPA's and allows for extensibility with other libraries.

## Decision

The app will be an spa using React as the front end. Code will be written from create-react-app

## Consequences

Quick to spin up the app.

Should we require complex prod version, may need to roll out from create-react-app template.
