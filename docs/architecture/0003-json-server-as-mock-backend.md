# 3. json-server as mock backend

Date: 17/08/2019

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To deliver the app quickly, we will need to code against a mock backend. We still need to demonstrate functionality so this should be a simple working library.

json-server is a lightweight rest implementation over a json "database".

## Decision

json-server will be used as the backend.

## Consequences

Quick to code against a real backend.

Requires learning how to interact with json-server.

Will need to be replaced in future with a fully functioned backend.

Limited database to a json file.
